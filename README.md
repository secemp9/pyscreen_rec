# screen_rec
Screen Recorder supporting various libraries

TODO:
- Add the rest of the attribution and credit for certain functions
- Fix the mouse since it's only present most of the time instead of all the time
- Fix the DPI scaling support (it's not really working right, at least according to the resulting video/frame)
- Fix the fps count, since it's really confusing to see 14 fps when it's actually much faster than that, seriously
- Fix mss so it support displaying the cursor too
- Add more features?
